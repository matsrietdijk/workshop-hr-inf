# Assignment 2 - Reorder the authors

On the [about](http://0.0.0.0:4567/about) page the client wanted to display all his authors. Your colleague implemented this but forgot one thing. The client requested to authors to be ordered ascending based on their name. Your colleague isn't available at the moment so you are assigned to fix this.
