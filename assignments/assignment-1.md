# Assignment 1 - Changing the title on the homepage

One of your clients is unhappy about the title on his websites homepage. Instead of the title being "Hello World!" the client would like it to be "Our Website".

Open up your editor and start editing the `app` file.

After changing the title its time to restart the application, head over to the Terminal application and press `Ctrl - c` to quit the website. Now type either `ruby app.rb` or `runhaskell app.hs` depending on the applications your are working on. The website should now be accesable on [http://0.0.0.0:4567/](http://0.0.0.0:4567/) in your browser.
