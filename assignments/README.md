# Assignments

## Case

Today is your first day at work for a new job. The company you now work for is specialised in webapplications and would like you to improve some of their clients websites.

## Picking an application

To do the assignments one of the two available webapplications have to be picked. One is a Ruby application and the other one is build with Haskell. You may pick either one, or if you feel like it you could do both.

The Ruby applications might be easier to understand when your new to programming. Did some programming before or have enough Ruby experience already? The Haskell version might bring some more challenges for you!
